# Credit Risk Analysis

Welcome to my **Credit Risk Analysis** project! This project demonstrates a machine learning approach to analyzing credit risk, using a dataset of customer financial and demographic information to predict loan approval decisions.

## Project Overview

- **Tools Used**: Python, Jupyter Notebook, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib
- **Skills Applied**: Data Cleaning, Feature Engineering, Classification Models, Model Evaluation
- **Dataset**: [Add information about the dataset here]

## Project Features

- Data preprocessing, including outlier detection and removal
- Automation of feature engineering using Column Transformer and Pipeline
- Multiple classification models: Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, etc.
- Hyperparameter tuning using Randomized Search
- Model evaluation with Precision-Recall Curve, F1-Score, and Learning Curves
